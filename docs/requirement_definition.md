# Requirements Definition

> Group 13 -- Dan's Frappy shoppe

## Introduction and Context

Due to the recent explosion in popularity, Dan's Frappiccino shop, _Frappy's_ has been experiencing a massive increase in customers and orders. In addition to this, they've also needed to hire a large number of new employees to manage these orders, which their payment system is having trouble managing, and are constantly running out of inventory for their favorite products. Overall, this has slowed down Frappy's growth, and led to a decreased overall customer experience, with customers experiencing unreasonable wait times or being unable to purchase their favorite drinks. The goal of this project is to create a web-based application to solve these systems by allowing customers to place orders online, while also allowing managers to oversee staff and inventory.

A customer will be able to create a custom order for their drink ahead of time, reducing the time needed for Frappy's to process their order as well as saving the Customer time by avoiding having them wait in line. Drinks will be choosable via a variety of customizable presets or be buildable from the ground up via a "create-your-own" option. The system will allow customers to pay via their registered account balance, reducing payment fees and encouraging customer spending via a pre-purchased "gift card" system. Additionally, the account system will allow customer's and Frappy's to track order history. This should allow customers more convenient access to their favorite drinks, and give Frappy's a better ability to estimate inventory trends.

Baristas will be able to use the system to view a queue of available drinks, reducing downtime, and increasing productivity by allowing them to optimize the order of drink creation. This will also allow them to mark orders as complete, letting the customer know their order is done immediately.

Cashiers will be able to use the system in order to place an order on behalf of a specific customer, drawing funds from the customer's balance. This should allow customers to order in-store if they forgot to order beforehand online.

Managers will have admin-level access to the system, allowing them to track and manage other users' accounts and balances. Using this functionality, they will be able to automatically pay employees at the end of the week with minimal difficulty. Managers will also be able to edit the drink menu as they see fit, allowing them to adapt to shortages and respond to customer demands.

All employees should be able to log their hours worked. This will assist in the automated payment system, and reduce the overhead of using a ticket system.

## Users and their Goals

The users of this system can be divided into two main categories: customers and employees. Customers will use the system to place orders, and should only be able to interact with their own accounts. Employees, which can further be subdivided into cashiers, baristas, and managers, will use the system to process orders, track work time, manage payments, and manage inventory. Employee access to account information should be broader than customer's, following a principle of least privilege.
