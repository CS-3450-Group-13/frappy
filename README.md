# Milestone 1

## Build Instructions

When pulling the repo down from Github, remove the package-lock.json file and run `npm install`

### Installation Requirements

```version
python3 >=3.10
node    >=16.17
```
## Table of Contents

[Documentation](docs/ ) - Contains the project documentation and references.

[Source](src/) - Project Code

[Frontend](src/frontend/src)

[Backend](src/backend/frappy)

## Version Control

Version control will take place through github using git.  New features / bugs will be addressed as issues, which will then be assigned out.  Completed features and bug fixes will be submitted though forks relating to the specific issues referenced.

## Stack overview

For our project, we will be using a custom stack consisting of React, Django, and Postgres (RPD)

This can be expanded during production to a NGINX, Gunicorn, Django host.

- Django - Provides the REST API, user authentication, and serves static files via a reverse proxy with NGINX.
- React - Provides a front end framework for building web and mobile applications, and allows us to fetch page specific javascript allowing for a simple to use SPA.
- Postgres - A free to use robust relational database.

## Testing

Testing is performed using JEST and pytest and can be run using

```powershell python runtests.py```

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:
```npm test```

## Milestone 3

Milestone 3 contains the first working demo of our project, however the "scalable" stack involves many separate processes to get up and running.  To get started follow the instructions below.

### Running the Project

#### Requirements

- NodeJS >16
- Python >3.9
- Docker Destkop

To build and run the frontend, navigate to `/src/frontend` and run

```node
npm install
npm start
```

To build and run the backend web server, follow the instructions inside `/src/server`'s [README.md](/src/server/README.md).  This will guide you through creating a virtual environment that our init script can use to build and link the server and database.

After both frontend and backend servers are running, head over to the link specified in your NPM terminal to open and view the website.

#### Testing

To run server side testing, navagate to `/src/server/frappy` with your virtual environment activated. 

Run:
```
python manage.py test
```

This will create a temp database and prefill it with test data.

### Final Build Instructions

#### Requirements

- NodeJS >16
- Python >3.9
- Docker Destkop

#### Frontend
