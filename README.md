## Stack overview

This can be expanded during production to a NGINX, Gunicorn, Django host.

- Django - Provides the REST API, user authentication, and serves static files via a reverse proxy with NGINX.
- React - Provides a front end framework for building web and mobile applications, and allows us to fetch page specific javascript allowing for a simple to use SPA.
- Postgres - A free to use robust relational database.
