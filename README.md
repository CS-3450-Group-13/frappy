## Build Instructions

When pulling the repo down from Github, remove the package-lock.json file and run `npm install`

### Installation Requirements

```version
python3 >=3.10
node    >=16.17
```

### Linux

If running a *nix system, use the provided `build.sh` script.

### Windows

On windows, run the included `build.pwsh` script.

The script will automatically pull any needed dependencies or smaller packages.
Each script may prompt you for the required passwords or user accounts.

In the future, this will be migrated over to a docker compose file to allow for a single command build.

## Stack overview

For our project, we will be using a custom stack consisting of React, Django, and Postgres (RPD)

This can be expanded during production to a NGINX, Gunicorn, Django host.

- Django - Provides the REST API, user authentication, and serves static files via a reverse proxy with NGINX.
- React - Provides a front end framework for building web and mobile applications, and allows us to fetch page specific javascript allowing for a simple to use SPA.
- Postgres - A free to use robust relational database.

## Testing

Testing is performed using JEST and pytest and can be run using

```powershell python runtests.py```

```npm test```
